Jai Shri Krishna to all my dear friends.
<br>
I am Sudeshna Chakrabarty. My daughter Ritabhari Chakrabarty got engaged on 5th June, 2020 to Shiva Ghosh, son of Uday Ghosh and Chameli Ghosh.
<br>
This perfect match was possible because of the guidance and support of the “SOULMATE.COM” marriage bureau handled by, Mr. Souvik Ghosh.
<br>
We have been active members of the WhatsApp group of SOULMATE.COM from the start. This great service provided by this marriage bureau without charging a penny, not only helps the candidates who reside in Kolkata but also those all across different states and countries in the world.
<br>
Finding a perfect match has become a big challenge for everybody irrespective of their castes since nobody has the time to help one another in their own fast-paced life. Hats off to Mr. Souvik GHOSH to take up this big challenge on her own and provide this selfless service along with her amazing team and resulting in beautiful successful matches made. Thanks to Mr. Souvik GHOSH and SOULMATE.COM, a lot of young souls have found their soul mate, including my daughter.
<br>
After attaining immense success through the WhatsApp group, Mr. Souvik GHOSH along with her team is all set to launch their official website of the “SOULMATE.COM” marriage bureau where two individuals can instantly connect. Through this website, one can find and connect to the candidate of their choice and preference very easily and conveniently. The website would have appropriate filters concerning age, caste and education and hence will lead to smooth to match and fulfill one's requirement.
<br>
I wish all the luck and success to Mr. Souvik GHOSH and her entire team for this beautiful new venture and I am sure they will continue matching more and more souls in the coming future.
<br>
From,
<br>
Sudeshna Chakrabarty and Family.
